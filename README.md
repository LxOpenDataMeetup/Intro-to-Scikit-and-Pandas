# Intro-to-Scikit-and-Pandas

## For people who don't like to read readme files: 
I don't want to read this, take me straight to the Notebook action:
* [Part 1 - The basics (Pedro)](https://github.com/LxOpenDataMeetup/Intro-to-Scikit-and-Pandas/blob/master/Intro%20to%20Data%20Science%20for%20Newbies%20part%201%20(Pedro).ipynb) 
* [Part 2 - Machine Learning (Ekaterina)](https://github.com/LxOpenDataMeetup/Intro-to-Scikit-and-Pandas/blob/master/Intro%20to%20Data%20Science%20for%20Newbies%20part%202%20(Ekaterina).ipynb) 

## For people who absolutely enjoy reading readme files: 

### What is this repository?
This is an introduction to Machine Learning useing [Scikit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). 

This introduction is collaboratively developed by members of the [Lisbon Open Data Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Lisbon-Open-Data-Meetup/) to give first time users a starting point with Machine Learning. It is in permanent beta, and probably full of spelling mistakes, but permanently improving.

The first thing to do is to clone this repository. If you don't know how to clone, you can also simply [download it as a Zip](https://github.com/LxOpenDataMeetup/Intro-to-Scikit-and-Pandas/archive/master.zip). To actually run it you will need to install Scikit, Pandas, and another few things, but we recommend simply installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) as it will include everything else in just one download. 

To open and run the ipython notebook, simply open a terminal and type `ipython notebook`.
